Initial Stable Release (08/11/2023)
- Only authentic Sandisk and Samsung cards are supported and recommended.
  - In my initial testing poor or unknown quality sd cards somestimes fail to reboot.  TO MINIMIZE ON POTENTIAL FRUSTRATION, ONLY USE AN AUTHENTIC SAMSUNG OR SANDISK SD CARD
- Follow the instructions from the wiki to properly loading this image: https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki#instructions-for-loading
- Initial boot and preparation can take about 5 minutes to complete due to the themes being copied.  Be patient!
- Be sure during initial boot, Only have the OS SD card in slot 1 (TF1/INT.) during the initial boot!.  Do not put an SD card in slot 2 (TF2/Ext.) during the initial boot!  Failure to follow this may result in strange behavior during the intial boot preparation process.
- Once the initial boot has completed and you're at the Emulationstation menu, you can insert your second sd card into slot 2 (TF2/Ext.).
- To make use of your second sd card for your games, go to options/Advancec/Switch to SD2 for ROMS.  For more information, see: https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---rgb30#q-how-do-i-make-use-of-the-second-sd-slot-for-roms-and-games
