Initial Stable Release (11/27/2024)
- Only authentic Sandisk and Samsung cards are supported and recommended.
  - In my initial testing poor or unknown quality sd cards somestimes fail to reboot.  TO MINIMIZE ON POTENTIAL FRUSTRATION, ONLY USE AN AUTHENTIC SAMSUNG OR SANDISK SD CARD
- Follow the instructions from the wiki to properly loading this image: https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki#instructions-for-loading
- Initial boot and preparation can take about 5 minutes to complete due to the themes being copied.  Be patient!
- Be sure during initial boot, Only have the OS SD card in slot 1 (TF1/INT.) during the initial boot!.  Do not put an SD card in slot 2 (TF2/Ext.) during the initial boot!  Failure to follow this may result in strange behavior during the intial boot preparation process.
- Once the initial boot has completed and you're at the Emulationstation menu, you can insert your second sd card into slot 2 (TF2/Ext.).
- To make use of your second sd card for your games, go to options/Advancec/Switch to SD2 for ROMS.  For more information, see: https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---rgb30#q-how-do-i-make-use-of-the-second-sd-slot-for-roms-and-games

Known Issues
- If your unit came with ROCKKNIX installed or you've run ROCKNIX on your unit, you must open your unit and unplug the battery for 10 seconds or it will not be able to safely shutdown.  The unit will just reboot.
  As a temporary workaround, if you shutdown the unit in ROCKNIX using the the proper shutdown process through the start menu, you will be able to shutdown safely in ArkOS,
  however, the solution is temporary because if you do a system reboot, the issue will return.
