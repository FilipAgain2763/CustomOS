### Before submitting your issue or feature request.  DO NOT REQUEST ASSISTANCE FOR PRELOADED IMAGES.  I do not support or condone the use of preloaded ArkOS images.  Preloaded meaning images that come with copyrighted roms preincluded.  Look for support from the creator or supplier of those preloaded images, not from here!  If a ticket is submitted for assistance for such images or if there's an indiciation that a preloaded image is what the support request is for, the issue ticket will be closed with no further response.

1. ***This is not the Stock OS that comes with your device, AmberElec, JelOS, ROCKNIX or UnOfficialOS.***  ArkOS is a different distribution from those systems and will have differing features.  The only somewhat similarity is that they both use EmulationStation as a frontend.  Even with that, the versions of EmulationStation that's used in between ArkOS and these other distributions is different with different capabilities.  If there are features you prefer with the other available distributions, just use those distributions instead.  The choice is yours.

2. Have you reviewed the Frequently Asked Questions section available for your supported device in the wiki?

3. If your issue is related to being able to run certain emulators or ports, have you reviewed the Emulators and Ports section available at https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/ArkOS-Emulators-and-Ports-information for needed bios files and supported rom extensions?

4. Have you reviewed the ***known issues*** section available at https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Known-issues ?
